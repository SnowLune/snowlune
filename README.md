### About me

I'm a recent graduate of a Full Stack Web Development program at the University of Minnesota, and I'm actively looking for my first engineering opportunity. I love solving unique problems with code, and I'm particularly interested in web accessibility. Some of my favorite technologies and languages include JavaScript, C/C++, Python, Rust, and Lua. I'm also comfortable working with Linux, BASH, and coreutils.

### Hobbies and interests

In my free time, I enjoy music and video games. I'm a big fan of Valorant and formerly played a lot of Overwatch. In fact, I was so inspired by Overwatch that [I created a Workshop mode coding AI for every single hero in the game](https://github.com/snowlune/ravensaidome).

Other interests of mine include SPACE - I'm a big NASA fan and the [JWST](https://jwst.nasa.gov/) really excites me.
