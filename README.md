## Hi, I'm Luna!
###### 27 | she/her
I like to code. I especially like to code things that really interest me. 
### Currently...
I'm currently in a full stack web development bootcamp learning all about HTML/CSS/Javascript and a myriad of web APIs

### Favourite technologies/languages
- C/C++, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Lua

### Hobbies and interests
I really love music and video games. Overwatch is probably my favourite multiplayer game. 

In fact, I like Overwatch so much [I made a Workshop mode coding AI for every single hero in the game.](https://github.com/snowlune/practicefieldexpanse)

**Other interests include:** *SPACE*, so much space. I'm a big NASA stan. [JWST](https://jwst.nasa.gov/) makes me almost outrageously happy.
